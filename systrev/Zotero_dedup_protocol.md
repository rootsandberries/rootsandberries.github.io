# Deduplicating systematic review searches in Zotero using tags

### Step 1 Import and organize files
* Import individual search results files by choosing File-->Import. Zotero accepts numerous file types including .ris and .bib.
* New folders will automatically be created for each file import. Organize all import folders into a new collection. Create a new collection by right clicking on My Library. Move import folders into the new collection by dragging and dropping.
* Rename import folders with database name and date of search by right clicking and choosing Rename collection.
* The number of items in each search can be seen by clicking on the folder. The number of items in the folder will appears in the right-hand pane. Verify that the number of items reflect the number of search results for each database search.

### Step 2 Create a colored tag
* Click on an article in your SR collection.
* Add a tag "[reviewname]" to one of the documents.
* Change the color of the tag by right-clicking on the tag in the tag window (bottom left) and choosing Assign Color.

### Step 3 Tag all items in collection
* Create an All Searches sub-collection in your parent collection.
* Drag and drop everything in each of the search sub-folders to the All Searches folder by clicking on an item in the folder and clicking Ctrl A to select all.
* The number of items in the All Searches folder should reflect the sum of the items in each database prior to deduplication. 
* Select everything in the All Searches folder. Drag and drop them on top of the new tag in the tag window.

### Step 4 Deduplicate the collection
* Scroll to the bottom of your collection folders and click on Duplicate Items.
* Click on the colored "[reviewname]" tag you created in the tag window.
* Merge item records when they appear to be a true duplicate. Check for differences in fields using the duplicate drop downs next to the fields in the right-hand pane.

### Step 5 Tagging non-duplicates
* During de-duplication, when you identify an item that is not a true duplicate, do not merge it but make a note of it. 
* Exit Duplicates mode by clicking on your All Searches folder. Find the non-duplicate that you just identified and add a new tag "NonDUP" to the item.
* In your tags window, find the NonDUP tag and assign it a color.
* Go back to Duplicates mode, and continue merging duplicate records. When items are not true duplicates, tag them by dragging and dropping to the NonDUP tag.

### Step 6 Dealing with non-duplicates
* Return to your All Searches folder and click on the NonDUP tag to bring up the possible non-duplicates.
* For anything in this list that is in fact a duplicate, click on the duplicate records using Ctrl click. Merge the records by right clicking and choosing Merge Items.
* After de-duplication, the number of items in your All Searches folder should reflect the number of unique items after de-duplication. You individual database search folders should have the same number of items as they did originally, unless duplicates within a database search were identified and merged in the deduplication process.
